# Conda Recipes for RMG-Py dependencies

Example recipes for the conda build system.
Run `conda build <recipe directory>`.

You have to use `conda >=  23.1.0` - see the [installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/).

See [the `conda` documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html) for information on how to make a recipe or just look at the examples here.
